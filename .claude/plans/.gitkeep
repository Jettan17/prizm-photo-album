# Plans Directory

This directory stores implementation plans created by `/design`.

## Files
- `current.md` - The most recent plan (created by `/design`)
- Archived plans can be stored with timestamps: `YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md`

## Workflow
1. `/design` creates a plan and saves it here
2. `/run` reads and executes the plan
3. After execution, plan can be archived or deleted
